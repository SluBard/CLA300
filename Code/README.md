# Advanced C++

C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages and is applied in a variety of domains, right from gaming to graphical user interface (GUI) programming and even operating systems. If you're looking to expand your career opportunities, mastering the advanced features of C++ is key.

The course begins with advanced C++ concepts by helping you decipher the sophisticated C++ type system and understand how various stages of compilation convert source code to object code. You'll then learn how to recognize the tools that need to be used in order to control the flow of execution, capture data, and pass data around. By creating small models, you'll even discover how to use advanced lambdas and captures and express common API design patterns in C++. As you cover later lessons, you'll explore ways to optimize your code by learning about memory alignment, cache access, and the time a program takes to run. The concluding lesson will help you to maximize performance by understanding modern CPU branch prediction and how to make your code cache-friendly.

By the end of this course, you'll have developed programming skills that will set you apart from other C++ programmers.
